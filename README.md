# Kaggle Competition: Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
In this project, I aim to explore and implement machine learning techniques to solve the "Unbalanced Class" problem. This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing the basics of machine learning for Unbalanced Class tasks.

## Problem Understanding
- The goal of this project is to handle the unbalanced class with or without using oversampling / undersampling techniques.

## Techniques:
- Applied SMOTE to oversample the unbalaced class.
- Applied Grid Search to find the best parameters of various models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting. Finalized Random forest as better model.
- Applied autoencoders to find balanced results.

## Impact:
Demonstrated the ability to tackle a classic machine learning problem, showcasing proficiency in building and validating predictive models using real-world data.
